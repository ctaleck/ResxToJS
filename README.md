ResxToJS
========

Resx2Js is a utility that converts .NET/C# resx files into a JavaScript file which contains 
a JSON of the .NET/C# resources.

This will allow you to store all your resources in one place on the .NET side and automatically regenerate them on the JavaScript side.

## Usage

To convert .resx files in your .NET solution into JavaScript files, use the following

```
ResxToJs.exe -i ".NET/C# resource files folder" -o "JS resource files folder"
```

By default, the generated JavaScript files use the same name as the C# resource files with .js appended to 
the end. To change this, use the below. 

```
ResxToJs.exe -i ".NET/C# resource files folder" -o "JS resource files folder" --jsFileName "JS filename"
```

The default name for the generated json object is Resources. To change this, use the below

```
ResxToJs.exe -i ".NET/C# resource files folder" -o "JS resource files folder" --jsObjectName "JS resources object name"
```

To pretty print the output JavaScript, use the below.

```
ResxToJs.exe -i ".NET/C# resource files folder" -o "JavaScript resource files folder" --prettyPrint
```
